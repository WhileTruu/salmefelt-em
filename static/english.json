  "homePageContent": "My creativity began in the coastal village of Salme, at a historic viking ship crossing. I have been inspired by simple juniper covered sheep pastures where fishermen laid their fish traps for repair. It's captivating to pass on the wisdom and experience of our ancestors through warm and homely items made with ancient felting techniques. Thank you to my parents, family, friends and everyone who wishes to feel this way as well!\n\nFind my creations in the [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/salmefelt) or [write to me](mailto:salmefelt@gmail.com) directly.",
